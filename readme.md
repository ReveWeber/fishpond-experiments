# Toward a Flash-Free Fishpond

I love [aBowman's fish gadget](http://abowman.com/google-modules/fish/), but it's Flash, which seems to be more restricted every year. Nowadays it won't even run for longer than a minute or so without clicking a play button.

Recreating an interactive fishpond with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript seemed like an excellent way to learn the associated skills. This repo includes my efforts along the way, starting with [MDN's breakout tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript).
